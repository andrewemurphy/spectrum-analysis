Analyzing audio frequency spectra using SciPy

Introduction:

Have you ever blown across the top of a bottle to hear the sound that it creates?
In this project, I plan to record the sounds made by a variety of bottles, with the hope to determine
a relationship between the physical dimensions of the bottle and the features of its audio spectrum.

wav-spectrum-plot.py : Reads audio data from .wav file, takes an FFT of the data, and plots the resulting frequency spectrum

samples              : Contains sample .wav files

    --> instruments  : Samples from musical instruments (from https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/sounds/instruments/)
    
    --> recordings   : Audio recordings taken on my Moto G8-Power Android device
